# Stack With Factory Design Pattern

When I saw the answer of `@jxh`'s to the question [how to implement dynamic method dispatcher in C](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17621544/dynamic-method-dispatching-in-c) in the stackoverflow, I've decided to fully implement a stack. The I realized factory design pattern would be proper to use here. 

# Docs

* modular

This folder includes stack implementation with factory and it is more modular.

* onefile

This folder includes stack implementation without factory and there is only one file.
